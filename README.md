# First Project Webpage

## Description

This is the first-ever independently created website as part of the coding bootcamp assignments. It is an application of the materials learned during module 1 of the bootcamp such as the use of semantic elements in HTML, as well as the use of color, fonts, the box model, position, and display properties in CSS.

## Installation

## Usage

To use this website and see the different elements applied, users should minimize the screen if working on a desktop computer. The header should remain fixed to the top of the page while the user scrolls through the rest of the content on the page. With the desktop screen minimized, clicking on "Contact" in the menu items should cause the page to jump directly to the contact form at the bottom of the page. However, these elements should display fine if working on a mobile device or computer tablet. A pseudo-class element was added so that when you hover over the menu items, they change color.
